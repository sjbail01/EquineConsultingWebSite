# EquineConsultingWebSite
Welcome my Code Louisville Co-horts and anyone interested in my first best effort!
I have included in my project/website some simple HTML mark-up, main.css file and a main.Js file.
My early version of this website will not include a Jason/node package to run, but later updates will. Stay tuned.
The idea behind the website was to offer my skills as a consultant to investors that do not have specialized knowledge in the Thoroughbred Equine industry and at the same time complete my Code Louisville project requirements.
We were required to incluse some CSS, Java Script and HTML markup in our project aswell as pick 3 additional features. 
I chose 
1) Custom trasition animation- my logo scrolls across the page when hitting order button under "What we do" page.
2(Hide\show feature: I have hidden my images when in responsive layout. 
3)Run PageSpeed Insights (easy): result 
4)Run accesability check: I did this is lighthouse and Pagespeed.web/dev- result 100 % after changing text color from black to white on purple background color. 
5)Transition on an element: on menu buttons have hover color change
6)Responsive menu using CSS.
7)Responsive menu using Java Script.
