# EquineConsultingWebSite
Welcome my Code Louisville Co-horts and anyone interested in my first best effort!
I have included in my project/website some simple HTML mark-up, main.css file and a main.Js file.
My early version of this website will not include a Jason/node package to run, but later updates will. Stay tuned.
The idea behind the website was to offer my skills as a consultant to investors that do not have specialized knowledge in the Thoroughbred Equine industry and at the same time complete my Code Louisville project requirements.
We were required to incluse some CSS, Java Script and HTML markup in our project aswell as pick 3 additional features. 
 Iam using nmp version 18.19.3.
I chose 
1) Custom trasition animation- my logo scrolls across the page when hitting order button under "What we do" page.
2(Hide\show feature: I have hidden my images when in responsive layout. 
3)Run PageSpeed Insights (easy): Result's are ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112572131/202228456-b9ffe4fa-e13c-40eb-9c58-f0523a40338f.png) Perfomance=100, Accesabiltiy=100, Best Practices=92 & Seo=86.
4)Run accesability check: I did this is lighthouse and Pagespeed.web/dev- result 100 % after changing text color from black to white on purple background color. 
5)Transition on an element: on menu buttons have hover color change
6)Responsive menu using CSS.
7)Responsive menu using Java Script.
Web Deb 2....
Part 2 stay tuned. 
1) I have created an array to display product information in a table. This can be found on the "What we do" page. This fills requirement for #1 in section 1.
2) I added a email validation to my Order page, which can be found on "what we do page" and hitting white order button, which takes you to a form where the email validation can be found. This fills #3 on section #1 requirement.
3) Section 1 last requirement. I added a countdown feature. How many days to the KY Derby! this can be found on home page in Nav bar.
4) Section 2 #1 I added into my order form, which can be found when hitting order button on "What we do" page, a self filling city and state, when you add in a zip code (currently just US).
